# HardwareTemp

C# project that allows you to monitor your CPU and GPU/s temperature and loads.

It is based on the Open Hardware Monitor library for .net languages.

### Arduino
An arduino sketch is included to display all the HardwareTemp infos on a 16*2 lcd screen.

Just upload the sketch to the arduino in the "Gateway" folder, connect it to the computer and select the COM port in the HardwareTemp settings.





##### Troubleshooting
This is just the C# project. To use it you will have to compile it through Visual Studio.

If you have any problem , just delete the "settings.ini" file to reset to software.
