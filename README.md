# HardwareTemp

C# project that allows you to monitor your CPU and GPU/s temperature and loads.

It is based on the Open Hardware Monitor library for .net languages.

### Arduino
An arduino sketch is included to display all the HardwareTemp infos on a 16*2 lcd screen.

Just upload the sketch to the arduino, connect it to the computer and select the COM port in the HardwareTemp settings.
